{% img /images/lotus-notes.jpg Lotus Notes Download Dialog %}

In Lotus Notes, this is what one is prompted with after double clicking an attachment in an email.

There are really 2 things users want to do with email attachments:

1. Open it 
2. Download it

They've managed to split two actions into five buttons. Huzzah! It's bad UI magic!

Apprently, the edit button is in case you want to edit something and then have Notes automatically write the changes back to the email. What?? Why would anyone use their email as storage for a document?

This is one of Notes' (many) problems. It tries to be everything to everyone and succeeds at nothing in the process.

One simple feature is better than 10 complicated ones. For example, Gmail doesn't even support anything other than reverse chronological order in the list view. Does anyone really care? No. Because it's fast and simple.
